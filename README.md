# E-Commerce Data Analysis Project on macOs - DICODING

## Overview

This project as Final Submission of 'Belajar Analisis Data dengan Python' learning path that focuses on analyzing a provided dataset by performing data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations to address defined business questions. An interactive dashboard will be built using Streamlit to present the results effectively.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- **data/**: Houses CSV files related to the dataset.
- **notebook.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook used for data cleaning, exploration, and analysis.
- **dashboard/**: Contains files for the visualization dashboard (exact contents and usage may vary).
- **requirements.txt**: Lists all Python libraries and packages necessary for running the project.
- **url.txt**: Include URLs for data sources or external references used within the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure Python is installed on your macOS system. It's best practice to use a virtual environment for dependency management. Below are steps to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <rhttps://github.com/mmelinn/E-Commerce-Data-Analysis-Project-on-macOs---DICODING.git>
    cd <E-Commerce-Data-Analysis-Project-on-macOs---DICODING>
    ```

2. **Go to Project Directory**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

3. **Install the necessary packages**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Jupyter Notebook

To access and analyze the data, just run from the TextEditor (Visual Code Studio):
    ```bash
    cd E-Commerce-Data-Analysis-Project-on-macOs---DICODING/notebook.ipynb

### Running the Streamlit

To access and analyze the data, open the Jupyter notebook by executing the command:
    ```bash
    cd E-Commerce-Data-Analysis-Project-on-macOs---DICODING/dashboard
    streamlit run dashboard.py
